# Course Notes

Have designed and run experiments in monkeys and mice in the course of
my studies. Also have some coursework experience with neural networks,
machine learning, control theory, and signal processing.

# Additional Projects

* The Facewall: 2013  

A pulsating wall of illuminated faces.  Heads of various students were
turned into 3d models using Autodesk's 123d Catch software.  These
models were then cast in acrylic and backlit by Raspberry Pi
controlled LEDs pulsing morse code. My responsibilities in the project
lay in light control and head modeling, my partner did casting and
physical design.

* Meteor Map: 2013  

App written in Processing that displays where meteorites have been
found in the United States, with a mix of toggleable display modes:
geographical map with groundcover, geographical map with elevation,
treemap sorted by groundcover, treemap sorted by elevation. An attempt
to find where people find rocks from space. Conclusion: they find them
in Texas.

New Caltech grad seeking employment beginning early 2016.
Course experience has centered on brains, computation, and a
bit of physics, while job experience has included operating heavy
machinery and JavaScript web-front end work. Excited for new
challenges and laying strong groundwork for future progress.

**Out of country November 4th -- December 14th, with limited contact.**

# Work Experience

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
7/2014 -- 12/2014  
AuriQ Systems  
Datascience Intern  

Projects:   

* Prototyped dashboard using Ember.js and D3.js for display of data
  insights to customers in an attractive and comprehensible manner.
  - Set up Flask RESTful server on AWS with SQLite backend for demo purposes
* Analyzed advertising impression and click data with a smorgasbord of tools
  - Bash pipe and stream with Awk and Sed
  - Python with SciPy and Pandas
  - SQLite (the unsung hero)
* Wrote preliminary upgraded interface for AuriQ's ETL product
  using the Python argparse library

# Toolchain

## Languages

* Python
  - First choice language for getting things done, most usage has
	been as a Matlab replacement. Second greatest usage for small
	utility scripts.
	
* JavaScript
  - Toy project at https://github.com/techacolyte42/SpaceFiller
	
* C++
  - Used in general CS classes at Caltech, most comfortable
	language for algorithm implementation.
	
* Matlab
  - Largely replaced by Python workflows. Have used for fMRI analysis
	and dynamic systems analysis (although I've found Mathematica to be
	more useful for the latter).
	
* Racket Scheme
  - To the level of about page 225 of SICP.

## Other

* Linux
  - Familiar with the Bash pipe/stream workflow. Can't write an Awk or Sed
	command without an open reference but am aware of their usefulness.

* Emacs

* LaTeX
  - Used for PDF version of this resume.
  
* Git

* SQLite

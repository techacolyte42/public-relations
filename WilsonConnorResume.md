New Caltech grad seeking employment beginning early 2016.
Course experience has centered on brains, computation, and a
bit of physics, while job experience has included operating heavy
machinery and JavaScript web-front end work. Excited for new
challenges and laying strong groundwork for future progress.

# Education

California Institute of Technology  
Bachelor of Science  
Engineering and Applied Science - Computation and Neural Systems  
2009 -- 2015  


# Toolchain

## Languages

* Python
  - First choice language for getting things done, most usage has
	been as a Matlab replacement. Also have experience with
	the argparse module implementing new Bash interface for AuriQ
	product.
	
* JavaScript
  - Prototyped a dashboard data visualization project
	using Ember.js and D3.js.
	
* C++
  - Used in general CS classes at Caltech, therefore most comfortable
	language for algorithm implementation.
	
* Matlab
  - Largely replaced by Python workflows. Have used for fMRI analysis
	and dynamic systems analysis (although I've found Mathematica to be
	more useful for the latter).
	
* Racket Scheme
  - To the level of about page 225 of SICP.

## Environment

* Linux
  - Familiar with the Bash pipe/stream workflow. Can't write an Awk or Sed
	command without an open reference but am aware of their usefulness.

* Emacs

## Etc

* LaTeX
  - Used for PDF version of this resume.
  
* Git

* SQLite
